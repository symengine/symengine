# CSymPy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/certik/csympy.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/certik/csympy)

CSymPy is a standalone fast C++ symbolic manipulation library.
Optional thin Python wrappers allow easy usage from Python and
integration with [SymPy](http://sympy.org/).

## License

All files are licensed under MIT license, see the
[LICENSE](https://raw.github.com/certik/csympy/master/LICENSE) for more
information. The `src/teuchos` directory is licensed under the Trilinos BSD
license (see the LICENSE file).

## Installation

Install prerequisites.
For Debian based systems (Ubuntu etc.):

    apt-get install cmake libgmp-dev

For RPM based systems (Fedora etc.):

    yum install cmake gmp-devel

Install csympy:

    cmake .
    make

This will configure and build CSymPy in the default Release mode with all code
and compiler optimizations on.

Run tests:

    ctest

### Python Wrappers

The optional Python wrappers can be turned on by

    cmake -DWITH_PYTHON=yes .
    make

Use CSymPy from Python as follows:

    >>> from csympy import var
    >>> var("x y z")
    (x, y, z)
    >>> e = (x+y+z)**2
    >>> e.expand()
    2x*z + x^2 + 2y*x + 2y*z + z^2 + y^2

You can read Python tests in `csympy/tests` to see what features are
implemented.

### Development

The Travis-CI checks the code in both Release and Debug mode with all possible
checks, so just sending a GitHub pull request is enough and you can use any
mode you want to develop it. However, the best way to develop CSymPy is to use
the Debug mode, turn assertions on and turn `BFD` support on (prints very nice
stacktraces on exceptions, segfaults or assert errors):

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
        -DWITH_CSYMPY_ASSERT=yes \
        -DWITH_BFD=yes \
        .

To make `WITH_BFD=yes` work, you need to install `binutils-dev` first,
otherwise you will get a `CMake` error during configuring.
For Debian based systems (Ubuntu etc.)

    apt-get install binutils-dev

For RPM based systems (Fedora etc.)

    yum install binutils-devel

### CMake Options

Here are all the `CMake` options that you can use to configure the build, with
their default values indicated below:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="/usr/local" \  # Installation prefix
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" \         # Type of build, one of: Debug or Release
        -DWITH_BFD:BOOL=OFF \                         # Install with BFD library (requires binutils-dev)
        -DWITH_PYTHON:BOOL=OFF \                      # Build Python wrappers
        -DWITH_CSYMPY_ASSERT:BOOL=OFF \               # Test all CSYMPY_ASSERT statements in the code
        -DWITH_CSYMPY_RCP:BOOL=ON \                   # Use our faster special implementation of RCP
        .

`CMake` prints the value of its options at the end of the run.
If you want to use a different compiler, do:

    CXX=clang cmake .

and check that CMake picked it up.

## Developer Documentation

Please follow the [C++ Style Guide](doc/style_guide.rst) when developing.

The design decisions are documented in [Design](doc/design.md).

Memory management is handled by RCP (reference counted pointers) from
`Trilinos` (module `Teuchos`). We have copied the relevant files into
`src/teuchos`, so no external dependency is needed.  Brief code snippets of the
most frequent operations are given in our [C++ Style
Guide](doc/style_guide.rst), this is useful to consult if you are unsure about
the syntax.  In order to understand how it works under the hood, read
[Teuchos::RCP Beginner's
Guide](http://trilinos.sandia.gov/RefCountPtrBeginnersGuideSAND.pdf) (pdf).
Finally, more thorough exposition is given in [Teuchos C++ Memory Management
Classes, Idioms, and Related Topics --- The Complete
Reference](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~rabartl/TeuchosMemoryManagementSAND.pdf)
(pdf).

`Teuchos`' RCP implements reference counting of objects, exactly like Python
works. When an object runs out of scope, its reference count is decreased. When
it is copied, its reference count is increased. When reference count goes to
zero, it is deallocated. This all happens automatically, so as long as our C++
Style Guide is followed, things just work.

When `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` is set in our `CMake` (the default), then
`Teuchos` is compiled with debugging support, which means that as long as you
follow our C++ Style Guide, the C++ code should never segfault (since you never
access raw pointers that could segfault and Teuchos raises nice exception with
full stacktrace if there is any problem, very similar to Python). Use this mode
when developing.

When `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, then `Teuchos` is compiled without debugging
support, which means that all pointer operations become either as fast as raw
pointers, or very close. As such, there is pretty much zero overhead. However,
in this mode, the program can segfault if you access memory incorrectly. This
segfault however would be prevented if `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, so always use
the Debug build to test your code, only when all tests pass you can enable
Release mode.

The Trilinos RCP pointers as described above are only used when
`WITH_CSYMPY_RCP=OFF` is set in `CMake`. The default option is
`WITH_CSYMPY_RCP=ON`, which uses our own implementation of `RCP` (see
`src/csympy_rcp.h`). Our implementation is faster, but it only implements a
subset of all the functinoality and it requires all our objects to have a
`refcount_` variable. Otherwise the usage of our RCP is identical to
`Teuchos::RCP`, and Travis-CI tests both implementations of RCP to make sure
the code works with both.
