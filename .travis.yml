  ## All these variables are sent into the bin/test_travis.sh script. See this
  ## script to know how they are used. Most of them are just passed to cmake,
  ## so if they are not set, cmake will use a default value. For the rest, the
  ## bin/test_travis.sh script usually checks for either "yes" or "no" in an if
  ## statement, so if the variable is not set, the other if branch will get
  ## executed.

  - BUILD_TYPE="Debug" WITH_BFD="yes" WITH_SYMENGINE_ASSERT="yes"
  # Debug build (with BFD and SYMENGINE_ASSERT) with Python 2.7
  - BUILD_TYPE="Debug" WITH_BFD="yes" WITH_SYMENGINE_ASSERT="yes" WITH_PYTHON="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.7"
  # Debug build (with BFD and SYMENGINE_ASSERT and SYMENGINE_THREAD_SAFE)

  ## In-tree builds (we just check a few configurations to make sure they work):
  # Debug build without Python:
  - BUILD_TYPE="Debug" WITH_BFD="yes" TEST_IN_TREE="yes"
  # Debug build with Python 2.7:
  - BUILD_TYPE="Debug" WITH_BFD="yes" TEST_IN_TREE="yes" WITH_PYTHON="yes" WITH_SYMENGINE_ASSERT="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.7"
  # Release build with Python 2.7:
  - TEST_IN_TREE="yes" WITH_PYTHON="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.7"
  # Release build shared lib with Python 2.7:
  - TEST_IN_TREE="yes" WITH_PYTHON="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.7" BUILD_SHARED_LIBS="yes"

  # These test the default Release build with other Python versions
  - WITH_PYTHON="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.6"
  - WITH_PYTHON="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="3.3"
  - WITH_PYTHON="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="3.4"

  # These test the setup.py file
  - TEST_IN_TREE="yes" PYTHON_INSTALL="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.6"
  - PYTHON_INSTALL="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="2.7"
  - TEST_IN_TREE="yes" PYTHON_INSTALL="yes" PYTHON_VERSION="3.3"
