  ## All these variables are sent into the bin/test_travis.sh script. See this
  ## script to know how they are used. Most of them are just passed to cmake,
  ## so if they are not set, cmake will use a default value. For the rest, the
  ## bin/test_travis.sh script usually checks for either "yes" or "no" in an if
  ## statement, so if the variable is not set, the other if branch will get
  ## executed.
