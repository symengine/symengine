#SymEngine - How Things Work

SymEngine is a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++ (SymEngine was previously called CSymPy)

Website for SymPy : http://sympy.org

This document contains information about the decisions made when SymEngine evolved.<br/>
The plan is this along with [C++ Style Guide](https://github.com/sympy/symengine/blob/master/doc/style_guide.md) and [Design](https://github.com/sympy/symengine/blob/master/doc/design.md) doc should be exhaustive and contain all you need to know to contribute for SymEngine.<br/>

##RCP
Info about RCP

##Dict
Info about the dicts used everywhere

##Classes
Info about basic, other subclasses - about hash, eq<br/>

##Modules
Provide some specific information if you feel like, for example in ntheory, function, matrix, diophantine etc.

##Evaldouble

##Single dispatch, double dispatch, Visitor patter.

##CWrappers

##CXX, Cython

##Python, Ruby & Julia Wrappers

##Compatablities with SymPy, Improvements and Shortcomings compared to SympY
